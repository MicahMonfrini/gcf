      Our History
    </h4>
    <p class="about-text">
      In January, 2007 several families who had been attending bible studies together since 2003, recognized what God had been doing in their midst and stepped out to formally establish Grace Community Fellowship. Larry Loden, who had been one of the teachers in these bible studies, was recognized as an elder during that time and set apart for the shepherding of Grace Community Fellowship.  What began as “part time” by 2009 became “full time” as the local body continued to grow.  The increase moved us out of meeting in our personal residences to an empty farm house we rented until 2010.  During those years, Ron Padula was recognized as a deacon followed by Dave Wolfe, James Lawrence and Micheal Starch. In 2010 we moved to our present location just east of Ronald Regan Blvd. on Hwy 29.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="about-text">
      Our Sundays have always been filled with expositional preaching and teaching from God’s word, the weekly sharing of the Lord’s supper, and a fellowship meal afterwards where we all have the opportunity to minister to one another on a more personal basis.  Our weekdays included Bible studies for youth, men, and women.  Our summers and holidays became opportunities to spend time at camps with other likeminded churches where the preaching of God’s Word was the focal point of the gathering.  The women were meeting regularly on Saturday mornings for prayer and by God’s abundant grace we were continuing to grow in Christlikeness.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="about-text">
      In 2013 we began to recognize the need for another full-time pastor to help with the shepherding and training responsibilities.  In 2014 we stepped out by faith in God to supply for our need and invited Fred Perry to join us.  Fred and his family joined us in April 2014.  God has provided and is continuing to bless us through Fred’s ministry to us here.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="about-text">
      From all the years of teaching from God’s word, establishing a solid foundation of truth on which to stand and work from to further His kingdom, God has been gracious to mature and multiply us and given us hearts to reach out to the world around us.  2015 has been an exciting year where we are growing in opportunities to be involved evangelizing in our own community through various evangelistic efforts, offering free counseling, giving away bibles and working in local prisons. God has also given us the opportunity and joy to begin partnering with others to strengthen churches and evangelize the lost in other parts of the world including, Honduras, China and Lebanon.  We are thankful for the grace that has been abundant in this local expression of Christ body in Georgetown, Texas.
